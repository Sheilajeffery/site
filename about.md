I'm a 24 year-old Software Developer from Bra&#537;ov, Romania. I'm currently at Twelve40 Inc. in Brighton, UK, where I work as a in back-end web developer. I write mostly Java, but also dabble in PHP when the need arises.

When I'm not elbow-deep in Java I like to work out, read, drink coffee, write poetry, listen to indie/acoustic music and go for countryside walks.

I am wife to Alex, a follower of Jesus, INFP, littlemrsjeffery, a Siegel.
